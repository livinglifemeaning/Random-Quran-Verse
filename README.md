# Random-Quran-Verse
Generates random quran ayah. My spin off project #10 of Brad Traversy's 50 Projects in 50 Days. First time working with an API

Learned: 
- fetching information from an api and using its data!
- can set direction and language directly into block element for working with Arabic
- really proud of my javascript
